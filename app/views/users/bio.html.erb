  <h2 class="perm-font">Hello, my name is Krista.</h2>
  <p>I'm an impact-driven, dedicated and socially conscious professional, 
  passionate about driving positive change to my organization and the world. 
  As a fullstack software engineer, I am JavaScript and Ruby focused, with 
  an aptitude for learning new technologies. Have a problem you're working on?
  Connect with me, I'd love to help you solve it.</p>

  <p>Previously, I helped veterans figure out what to do in their post-military
  career through American Corporate Partners, I planned public events for 
  Brooklyn Bridge Park Conservancy, and I started my career building a youth 
  camp at a horse barn. I'm adventurous, experimental, and curious to find new 
  solutions for old problems. I hold a Bachelor's in Human Rights, Politics 
  and Development from NYU, and am conversational in Spanish. </p>
